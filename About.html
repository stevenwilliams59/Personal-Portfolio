    <h1>Here's some information about me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hi, my name is Steven Williams and I am starting out on my journey into web development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am a current student at <a href = "https://northcoders.com/" target = "_blank">Northcoders</a> having began my 14 week bootcamp on 16/11/2020.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Having spent 12 years working in the print industry I had achieved all the goals I set out to and felt ready for a new challenge. 
         I left the printing industry and began working as a police constable, and in my spare time I began learning to code via 
         the freecodecamp platform. I fell in love with code and although the idea of making this into a career seemed a long way off I 
         decided to carry on learning with that being my end goal. I left the police force and went back into print to allow myself more time
         to study towards my end goal of becoming a software developer. I decided that the best route into web development was a coding bootcamp, I began 
         to research what was out there and decided that Northcoders was the best fit for me, so I applied for a spot on their developer pathway. I passed 
         my entry challenge and began the course on 16/11/2020. If you would like to know more about me please see the contact page where you can contact me directly.
